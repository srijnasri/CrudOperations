# Crud operations with core data
Core data is a apple provided **persistence framework** that assists us in caching large data onto the app device. It is an alternative to user defaults, which is generally used for small data. <br>
It **is not a database** but a API that helps us manage database. Its default peristence store is **SQLite**. <br>
This project includes basic CRUD ops on core data.
